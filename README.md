### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently trying like hell to complete my pre-course with Northcoders in time for the start of my bootcamp while also trying to learn jazz guitar and start getting out there, singing songs to people.

[My Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/nicotineapache) shows off some of my tunes.

Former Motion Tracker for Epic Games. Ready for a new set of challenges.

Oh, and I have a Jack Russell called Eddie. My pronouns are He/Him. One day I want to build a website which shows off all the stuff that I do, musically. Wanna collab on a lofi hiphop track?
